# Project Overview

This is a Jasmine test suite for a feedReader building upon a starter code from the Udacity FrontEnd Web Development Nanodegree Program.
[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)

# Why testing websites?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

# Instructions

To run the code you need to download the zip file and extract the files in the destination folder. Click on the index.html file to open the feedReader testsuite in your browser.
